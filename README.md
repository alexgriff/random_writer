# Random Writer

Open the GroupProblem1 pdf for project guidelines

*The idea and vast majority of the work of writing the instructions are not my own. I adapted the project from here http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1136/ (This specifically is found under Assignment 2 "Fun with Collections")
I only changed some of the wording to be in Ruby, not C++ with special Stanford collection classes, and added a few extra hints.*
